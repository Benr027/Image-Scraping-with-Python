### Today, a friend wanted to download some specific photos of a photograph he likes a lot on Flickr.. but that's a long and a boring task.. especially when the user has many photos.

### So, I just asking myself how I can automate this task.. and Python is the answer! As part of this project, I have uploaded photos of the houses.

# **Prerequisite**

### You'll need to install a few packages before you begin. If you don't have Python installed on your computer, visit the official [python.org](https://www.python.org/) website to download and install the latest version.

### Next, open your terminal to your project folder and activate a Python virtual environment [activate a Python virtual environment](https://www.makeuseof.com/create-manage-python-virtual-environments/) to isolate your dependencies.

- Python and Pip (the higher is better!)
- [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html): optional, but I advise you to use it.

## Finally, install the ***requests*** and ***BeautifulSoup*** packages using pip:
```
pip install bs4
pip install requests
pip install cssutils
```
